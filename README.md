# Founders and Coders - Weekly Prompt - Week 6 - Flexbox

## Project gallery

### Description

This website feature has been created as part of the application for the Founders and Coders training program in web development.

This is a project gallery, which uses a flexbox layout and features some of the websites Iâ€™ve built while working through the application requirements.
